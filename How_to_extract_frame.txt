Perfect! Extracting frames from your video is a great first step to build your custom basketball/hoop detection dataset.

## 🎬 Step-by-Step: Extract Frames from Your Video Automatically

We'll write a Python script to:
- Load your `.mp4` video
- Extract a frame every **N seconds** (or every Nth frame)
- Save them as images in a folder (e.g., `frames/`)

---

### ✅ 1. Create a Python Script

Save this as `extract_frames.py` in your project folder:

```python
import cv2
import os

# === CONFIG ===
video_path = "your_video.mp4"       # <- Change this to your actual video file
output_folder = "frames"            # <- Output folder to save frames
frame_interval = 30                 # <- Save 1 frame every N frames

# === SETUP ===
os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Cannot open video.")
    exit()

frame_count = 0
saved_count = 0

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    if frame_count % frame_interval == 0:
        filename = os.path.join(output_folder, f"frame_{saved_count:04d}.jpg")
        cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)
        print(f"Saved {filename}")
        saved_count += 1

    frame_count += 1

cap.release()
print(f"✅ Done! Extracted {saved_count} frames to '{output_folder}'")
```

---

### ⚙️ 2. How to Run

In your VS Code terminal:

```bash
python extract_frames.py
```

Make sure `your_video.mp4` is in the same folder or adjust the path.

---

### 🎯 Tip: Control Speed

You can change `frame_interval` to:
- `30` to get ~1 frame per second (if your video is 30 fps)
- `10` for more frequent frames
- Or extract every **N seconds** like this:

```python
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
frame_interval = int(fps * N)  # N seconds
```

---

## Next Step: Label the Frames
Once you have images, we can load them into a tool like **LabelImg** or **Roboflow** to annotate basketballs and hoops.
