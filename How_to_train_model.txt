Awesome, Dong! You're now stepping into **custom object detection**, and that's a great move 👏

To train a model to detect **basketballs** and **hoops**, you'll go through a few main steps:

---

## 🧠 1. **Understand the Basics**
You'll be training a custom YOLOv8 model. YOLO stands for "You Only Look Once" — it's fast and great for real-time object detection.

---

## 🗂️ 2. **Collect and Label Your Data**

### 📸 A. Collect Images or Video
- Use your `.mp4` video or take screenshots of:
  - Basketballs at different positions
  - The hoop (front view, side view, zoom in/out)
- Try to get **diverse angles**, lighting, and scenarios.

### 🏷️ B. Annotate Your Images
Use a labeling tool like:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) | Easy to use, open-source GUI tool |
| [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) | Web-based, lets you label and export for YOLO format |
| [CVAT](https://github.com/opencv/cvat) | More powerful, used in production setups |

Label:
- Class `basketball`
- Class `hoop`

You’ll end up with `.txt` files (YOLO format) for each image.

---

## 📁 3. **Organize Your Dataset**
Structure like this:

```
my_dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
├── labels/
│   ├── train/
│   ├── val/
```

Each `.txt` file should have the same filename as the image and include lines like:

```
0 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2  ← (class_id x_center y_center width height) normalized
1 0.3 0.6 0.1 0.15
```

---

## 🧠 4. **Train Your YOLOv8 Model**

Install the Ultralytics package (if not yet):

```bash
pip install ultralytics
```

Create a YAML file `basket_data.yaml` describing your dataset:

```yaml
path: /path/to/my_dataset
train: images/train
val: images/val

names:
  0: basketball
  1: hoop
```

Then train it:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=basket_data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
```

---

## ✅ 5. **Test Your Model**

Once trained, test it on new video or images:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt source=your_video.mp4
```

Or you can load it in Python:

```python
model = YOLO("runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt")
results = model("your_video.mp4")
```

## 💡 Optional: Use Roboflow to Speed Up Dataset Creation
Roboflow can help with:
- Labeling
- Auto-splitting train/val
- Exporting in YOLOv8 format
